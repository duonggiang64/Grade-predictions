### 🎓 Grade Predictions Assessment

### 📘 Project Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate a **machine learning model for predicting student grades** based on demographic, academic, and behavioral factors. Using the dataset `test.csv` and (`train.csv`), the notebook demonstrates how predictive analytics can be used to assess academic performance and identify key contributors to student success.

---

### 🧠 Objectives

* Perform **data exploration and preprocessing** to prepare the dataset for modeling.
* Train and evaluate a **predictive model** to estimate student grades.
* Analyze **feature importance** to understand which factors most influence academic outcomes.
* Communicate insights through visualizations and performance metrics.

---

### 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset (`test.csv`) and (`train.csv`) includes information related to:

* Student demographics and learning conditions
* Academic scores and behavioral data
* Target variable: **Final Grade / Performance Level**

---

### ⚙️ Methods & Tools

**Language:** Python
**Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
**Main Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

**Workflow:**

1. Data cleaning and transformation
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Model selection and training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
4. Model evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE
5. Interpretation of key predictors affecting grade outcomes
